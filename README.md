## Multiverse: Application Template 
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

This will be used with the in development `laboratory` library intended to
provide templates for the scaffolding functionality intended to speed up
creation of database objects, and controller interactions that are used in the
command-line interface (CLI), the web interface or web server daemon, or a 
graphical user interface (GUI). 

The Multiverse OS design guide outlines a structure that is required by all core
utilities and applications included by default (the default is defined by the
type of system being installed, Multiverse OS can be used as a headless server,
or a general use work station, comming fully capable of running OSX, Linux, and
even windows PE binaries). 

This project is intended to both simplify development of new application,
intended for use by Multiverse OS, or provided for the community and developed
collectively by the community. It illustrates some key design principals that
allow it to remain consistent with all other core applications, and it allows
interested developers in quickly learning the key design requirements to
volunteer and join the Multiverse OS development community. 

#### Volunteering 
The Multiverse OS development is a community driven project, developed
collectively, using a democratic process defined by a peer-to-peer (p2p)
protocol that is is included with Multiverse OS. This protocol defines a charter
for the Multiverse OS foundation, and powers a sustainable and long term
development project that includes open source hardware, open source software,
and development of community tools designed to provide platforms for support,
volunteering, hosting, email, messaging, and many other tools used to faciliate
the nucleaization of a international community organized as an open source
workers cooperative. 

#### The Multiverse OS Foundation
The Gravity protocol is the p2p network used to unite a team of volunteers,
collect funding to provide fair compensation for our biggest contributors if
possible. The protocol was not an afterthought, it is a fundamental core
component; enabling sustainable development, building a enterprise level support
apparatus, in addition to general end-user support aparatus made up of a variety
of web applications, community communication platforms, and a foundation
capable of raising money via enterprise support offfering, donations, open
source hardware sales, and will continue to open new sources of revenue without
a board of directors. The board of directors are the first jobs Multiverse OS
foundation has automated, and it has been replaced with literal administrative
executive automation software, in combination with democratic control mechanisms
built into the p2p Gravity protocol. 

#### The Open Labatory Toolkit 
The `laboratory` toolkit provides a collection of tools, for creating,
registering, volunteering, and contributing to new and existing Multiverse OS
projects. 

Multiverse OS initial development team, decided to put a large focus on
cultivating open source development, and project management tools. Multiverse OS
projects are organized in a graph data structure, and are interlinked together,
based on not just what projects depend on other projects, but what project
features and functionality depend on what other projects features and
functionality. The goal being to enable developers from novice skill level to
advanced skill levels, immediately and clearly see where in the Multiverse OS
greater ecosystem they can fit. 

These projects are not exclusively confined to software engineering, or even
software development. The projects require designers, graphical artists, 
musicians & audio engineers, 3D modeling (CAD design of PCBs, peripheral 
components, and computer designs). 

The Multiverse OS Foundation is an open source workers cooperative, driven
and organized primarily by a charter defined in the protocol specification, and
executed by the distributed p2p protocol. 

The Foundation is not exclusively made up of a p2p protocol, but is already 
currrently registered in Uruguay, and the United States; and The Multiverse OS 
Foundation will be extending to additional countries, extending our ability to 
establish an inernational network of volunteer. 

As the open workers cooperative grows, resulting in the volunteer network 
evolving into complex network of ineternational collectives that will form 
the sub-units of the greater Multiverse OS Foundation structure; it will rip
control out of the hands of corporations who continue to lie about the state of
Moores Law, who treat their laborers as disposable, creating devices that are
intentionally disposable, despite the continuous requirement of rare materials
that drive conflict, these companies build new devices, with essentially the
same hardware, sometimes literally featuring software upgrades masqueraded as
hardware improvements.

#### The Existing Model
These companies have enforced patents on concepts so generic, that a button to
quickly purchase an item on a website was patented, and enforced. And these same
companies want to jail their own users, when they have the audacity to want full
access to their own hardware, these companies have been caught sabotaging older 
verisons of their own hardware to force their users to upgrade, and that is just 
 what we have discovered them doing.  

And despite all of this, despite the marketing and hype on products without any
significant hardware upgrades; these companies and their CEOs take credit for 
advancements often made by public insitutions. Whenever possible, they horde 
ideals, like greedy dragons, they hire government workers and use public
designed rockets from over 60 years ago, and claim they not only created them,
but that these are innovations, and innovations that are at all useful. 

We know rockets are not reliable enough to exfiltrate nuclear weapons, which is
required for human life to continue into the long term. But the vast wealths
obtained by taking open source software, installing it in a computer, and then
slapping their logo and marketing on it. The low effort task is what guarantees
their right to collect obscene amounts of money, indefinitely, at the cost of
upgrading the UI every couple of years or less. 

And these companies are the reason we will not see a more reliable space
elevator, because that would require research and development, and they can make
more money by selling government technology back to them, while pretending the
CEO himself is responsible for this supposedly new innovation, when at every
opportunity every single psuedo-techno wizard in leadership roles are charlatans
who think taking a one way trip to a literally dead planet is not a half bad
delusion to sell, a promise that never has to be tested or fullfilled, while
still being rewarded the clout that comes a long with it. 

And despie all of this lines snake their way around major cities every year 
when the "new" device is introduced, despite Moore's law collapsing over 5 
years ago, almost a decade now; and they keep dressing it up, and reselling the 
same hardware, at the cost of our planet and of human life. 

And the cost is just the internet. 

When as many computers exist the datacenters of three companies, ISPs block our
ability to host, upload, and share, and the internet slowly becomes dominated by
TV platforms, turning our decentralized uncensorable 2-way communication streams
growing in complexity, limited primarily by our creative vision, shut down,
walled off, and **de-federated** purposefully, for profit. 

To replace it with a slightly better version of the TV; a model for a new TV
that wa previously possible, but never done because it did not align with
corporae interest, and we found out, neither does the internet as we knew it. 


And the way we fix this? We do it by uninstalling corporate operating systems,
because there is no exaggeration in stating: these are the systems that not only
control our lives, but dicatate how we organize, and if we can communicate
privatley. 

Uninstall, and install a new operating system, a new democratic controlled,
international, cooperatively owned, and focused around scientific,
technological innovation, security and privacy of users, and improving our lives
with new ways of communicating, sharing, and orgnaizing. 



#### A New Approach
A new approach that brings devices that do not require hackers to thwart the
security of our devices to obtain basic control over our hardware.

A open source workers cooperative, formed from international collectives,
building and contributing to open source hardware designs, featuring actual
improvements, actual innovation, and new approaches to persisting problems, that
corporations simply have no incentive to solve. 

Together, democratically (instead of plutocratically, a type of authoritarian), 
advancing open source computing, deciding the future of paths of the technology, 
and recycling hardware that exists, recombining it and and improving the
firmware to improve equipment functionality the same way JPL extended the life
of the Mars Rover years past its expected lifespan and extended its
functionality beyond what was originally believed. 

And the rewards will not be establishing collective ownership and 
returning democratic control, and control over their mobile devices, to the 
creators and users of Multiverse OS. 

The original developers of Multiverse OS do not, and will not own the profits of
open hardware sales, resources collected, properties obtained (to create
community centers and provide safe and worker focused places of work), and
every idea generated, will be **collectively owned by everyone**.
